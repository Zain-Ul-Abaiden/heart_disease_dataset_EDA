# Heart Dataset Project

This project is focused on analyzing and modeling the Heart Disease dataset. The goal is to explore the data, perform preprocessing, and build predictive models to identify the presence of heart disease.

## Project Structure
- `data/` – Contains the raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and modeling.
- `src/` – Source code for data processing and modeling.
- `outputs/` – Generated outputs such as figures, model files, and reports.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd heart_dataset
   ```
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data and build models.
- Use scripts in `src/` for data processing and model training.
